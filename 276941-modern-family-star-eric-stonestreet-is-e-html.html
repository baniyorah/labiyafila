In Schweitzer’s case, she flashed her beautiful smile in all three pics.</p><p class=Fg>Shortly after sharing the slideshow (found at the bottom of the page), the couple’s famous friends, including Michael Bublé, Bethenny Frankel, Gwyneth Paltrow, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/eric-stonestreet-engaged-to-lindsay-schweitzer/>congratulated them</a> in the comment section.</p><p class=Fg>The pair met during the Big Slick charity weekend in Kansas City in mid-2016, proving that she's involved in charity work. They were first reported as a couple in <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/modern-family-star-eric-stonestreet-is-dating-pediatric-nurse-lindsay-schweitzer/>August 2017</a>, though.</p><p class=Fg>Since they prefer keeping their relationship away from the spotlight, the details of their romance are scarce. However, Stonestreet has posted hilarious videos on social media of him playing pranks on her.</p><p class=Fg>During an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, who once described Schweitzer as “<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/eric-stonestreet-engaged-to-lindsay-schweitzer/>lovely</a>,” he talked about the best prank he ever got on her, and it involved “Modern Family” creator Christopher Lloyd.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>Stonestreet is not the only former “Modern Family” star who has attracted attention lately.</strong></h3><p class=Fg>For about two months, he grew a “ridiculous” mustache that Schweitzer hated. To make things more believable, he told her the show would include it in the last season and even asked Lloyd to send him <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SenGYaolB8k&ab_channel=TheEllenShow">fake emails</a> with “story ideas” for the mustache.</p><p class=Fg>The night before filming, Stonestreet got up in the middle of the night and shaved it. When Schweitzer woke up, she was understandably worried and confused, and he told her, “Oh my God! I sleep-shaved!” Luckily, she enjoys his pranks.</p><p class=Fg>Before Stonestreet started dating Schweitzer, he and <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/201209249413/charlize-theron-eric-stonestreet-dating/>Charlize Theron</a> sparked dating rumors.
