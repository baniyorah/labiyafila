Yung Gravy has made a name for himself with his satirical yet bold songs. Contrary to most artists, his music has remained the same throughout his career—frivolous and funny. And Gravy doesn’t mind.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Even when he was called a meme rapper for his lyrics that lacked substance, he embraced it. In fact, the rapper paved the way for dozens of artists who followed in his footsteps to make similar music.</p><p>But how did Gravy find success by making such unconventional music? The question can be answered after looking at the social media star’s four-year experience in branding and marketing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Drawing from his experience in the venture capital world, Gravy promoted artists like bbno$ (pronounced baby no money) and got promoted in return. Soon, his music gained popularity for its catchy beats and daring lyrics.</p><p>Now, Gravy’s music has earned him multiple platinum hits and over a billion stream, along with providing a significant boost to his net worth.</p><h2>Promotions and Collaborations Paved The Way</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Gravy has been making music&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">since 2016</a>. He initially started by just&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">freestyling</a>&nbsp;with his friends and with no particular themes or directions to his songs. And that is where his bold lyrics came from. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even when Gravy started uploading his works on SoundCloud and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>, his music stayed the same. And while his type of music has a small niche, he found success through&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">promoting</a>&nbsp;and collaborating with other artists. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The rapper follows the same process to this day. And because of it, he has worked with artists like Y2K, bbno$, Chief Keef, and Ski Mask, among many others.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Gravy Draws Inspiration from Multiple Artists and Genres of Music</h2><p>Aside from frequent collaborations and catchy beats, Gravy’s music’s defining feature is the usage of&nbsp;samples&nbsp;from soul music, reggaeton, and Spanish music. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Some of the most known songs he’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sampled from</a>&nbsp;are ‘It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia,’ ‘Careless Whisper,’ and ‘Mr. Sandman’.</p><p><span>The young rapper has sampled from all sorts of genres and hasn’t been shy of opening up about his influences. In an interview with&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>SubStream Magazine</span></a><span>, Gravy shared that he was into rappers like Tupac and Curren$y, with the latter being his idol.</span></p><p><span>He has also expressed his&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>interest</span></a><span>&nbsp;in sampling ‘</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>7th Element</span></a><span>’ by Russian singer Vitas. And it seems that Gravy will only keep on expanding his musical vocabulary as time goes by, given how often he collaborates with other artists and learns from them.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span>Gravy’s Music is Carefree</span></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>&nbsp;</h2><p><span>Yung Gravy has reached for music from different corners of the world and incorporated it into his works. Still, he has remained true to his fun persona and included many references and fun easter eggs in his songs.</span><span></span></p><p><span>One of the most popular ones was the&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Chuck Testa</span></a><span>&nbsp;meme on his ‘</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Whip A Tesla</span></a><span>’ song made together with bbno$.</span></p><p>But setting his meme rapper image aside, Gravy says that he wants people to feel carefree through his music.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Fun, giving people like a way to feel carefree and looking for one word, I’d say something like that, like carefree or, or fun.
