The Haitian-born designer's life was far from easy. After losing his mother when he was just a toddler, he was left in the care of his grandmother as his father moved to America. At the age of 13 he was adopted by a friend of his father and brought to Massachusetts. While in high school Prajje attended a class at Massachusetts College of Art and Design and found his calling in fashion. Soon he was Boston designer Andrea Alexander‘s assistant, helping with everything from sewing to organizing shows. He produced his first solo show as a high-school sophomore.</p><p>Encouraged by his adoptive parents, Prajje went to the prestigious Massachusetts College of Art in Boston and later launched his self-titled line, Prajjé Oscar. The designer got his first big break when he was selected to present his spring/summer 2012 collection at New York Fashion Week by Celebrity Top Chef Marcus Samuelsson. This opened the doors to several other fashion shows in Miami, Washington, D.C., Boston and New York, where he presented his exquisitely crafted collections. His work was also featured in Harper’s Bazaar Vietnam, Elle, Rolling Stone, and&nbsp;Teen Vogue. Prajjé describes his design style as “retro chic, yet remarkably wearable”&nbsp;and is best known for his glamorous evening dresses and luxurious fabrics.&nbsp;</p><p>Prajje works with skilled artisans in Haiti to develop his one of a kind couture pieces and ready to wear collection with the intention of spreading awareness of the beauty and vibrancy of Haiti. Thanks to the pandemic, the designer had to shift his focus from his signature evening dresses to leisurewear and move his business online.&nbsp;We can't wait to watch Prajje's journey on the show.</p><p>'Project Runway' Season 19 premieres on Thursday, October 14, at 9 pm ET/PT.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikerG%2BwKOhnmWfqLCivoyjnJqmXZeuscDIrKueZZiWtrW1jJumq6ZdmbK0tcannKtlkZm8scDEnWSapZWntqStjKmpqKKVmMFuvtSnrpqxXaPGp8OMnZybraQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rapper-lil-wayne-welcomes-a-son.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rapper Lil Wayne Welcomes a Son</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pardis-saremi-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pardis Saremi Wiki | Latest In Bollywood</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-perrys-assisted-living-release-date-plot-cast-trailer-bet-sitcom-grandpa-grumpy.html>'Tyler Perry's Assisted Living': Release date, plot, cast, trailer and all you need to know about th</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-morrison-net-worth.html>Adam Morrison Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliya-janell-biography.html>Aliya Janell Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-stevenson-of-victoria-is-missing-help-police-to-find-her.html>Amanda Stevenson of Victoria is missing, help Police to find her</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./genesis-ali-dean.html>American Celebrity Kid, Genesis Ali Dean Is Youngest Son of American Well Known Musician Couple, Ali</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
