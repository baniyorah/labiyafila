The city has excelled in entertaining reality TV fans with shows like <a href=# rel=follow>Jersey Shore</a>, Real Housewives of Jersey, <a href=# rel=follow>Cake Boss</a>, Jersey Couture, and Jersey Bell.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>One such reality show is Jerseylicious. This reality series premiered on March 21, 2010, and ran for six seasons within four years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The first five seasons aired on the now-defunct Style Network, whereas the finale was picked up by Food Network On Demand.&nbsp;The show revolved around stylists who work at various salons in Green Brook Township in New Jersey.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The salons included The Gatsby Salon, Anthony Robert Salon, and The Glam Fairy.&nbsp;However, the cast doing their job was not the only premise of the show. It had everything from industry competition and catfights to relationships and breakups.&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since the series ended, many fans have wondered where are they now? The cast of Jerseylicious&nbsp;that is. It has been a while since the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cast</a> has made it to the news, so here is everything we know about their current status.&nbsp;</p><h2>Olivia Blois Sharpe</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Olivia Blois Sharp has changed a lot in the last eight years, which may surprise some people. Since she quit wearing an artificial tan and excessive makeup, she has become nearly unrecognizable from her previous self.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She used to work as the main makeup artist at The Gatsby Salon and Anthony Roberts, but she currently lives in New York and runs a few businesses.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She also founded the Two Virgos apparel brand. However, the website for the brand is defunct, and its Instagram has had no posts since 2017.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her ex-boyfriend, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mike Atkari</a>, was discovered dead at his house on Long Island in March 2017. He used to be featured on Jerseylicious as Sharpe's boyfriend, but the pair were not together at the time of his death.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her current relationship status, on the other hand, remains unknown.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Tracy Dimarco</h2><p>Tracy Dimarco was one of the show's main cast who frequently clashed with Sharpe. She has worked at each of the three salons featured on Jerseylicious and is now the proprietor of Princess Armor.&nbsp;</p><p>Princess Armor offers a variety of footwear, apparel, jewelry, and accessories. In addition, she and Jessica Romano-Calacione, a former Glam Fairy makeup artist, co-hosts a podcast called Bad Examples.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In 2013, Dimarco married Corey Epstein, with whom he had three children â€” Skylar James, Jayden Gene, and Julian Chase. Dimarco and Epstein divorced in 2019, and Dimarco is now a proud single mother.</p><p>She showcases her children and life on her Instagram, @tracydimarco_.&nbsp;</p><h2>Christy Pereira</h2><p>Not much has changed in Christy Pereira's life since Jerseylicious. She is still employed at The Gatsby Salon and is blissfully married to Danny Pereira. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She is also the mother of two children, Daniella Jeanne and Rocco Joseph, whom she frequently shares on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Gigi Liscio</h2><p>Gigi Liscio is still working as a stylist in her birthplace of New Jersey. On her Instagram feed, she shares a lot of cut and color ideas. She also offers hair accessories and clip-in extensions on her own website, Gigiliscious.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Liscio's on-again, off-again romance with Frankie on the show kept viewers fascinated. But, unfortunately, the pair did not end up together.&nbsp;</p><p>She has currently settled down with her partner Lou and has recently given birth to a daughter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Alexa Prisco</h2><p>Alexa Prisco is the owner of The Glam Fairy, a hair and makeup artistry business. From 2011 to 2012, she had her own spinoff program, The Glam Fairy.</p><p>She also has a daughter named McKayla, whom she adores and often shares pictures of her on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><h2>Gayle Giacomo</h2><p>Not much has changed in Gayle Giacomo's life since Jerseylicious as well. She is still the owner of The Gatsby Salon and works there. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She can also be seen collaborating&nbsp;with other brands on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Anthony Lombardi</h2><p>Anthony Lombardi has expanded his reach since Jerseylicious. He is the owner of his own salon, AR Salon, and the author of The Glamor State.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He is an entrepreneur who uses his Instagram who posts motivational posts. He is still actively involved in hair styling and posts his work on his social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lombardi is also a proud father to a kid, but the details of his love life are unknown.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKVp8CmxcuimqKnpah6pK3SrWWhrJ2h</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./htmldetails-of-hendon-hookers-parents-alan-and-wendy-hooker-family-of-nfl-player.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>`htmlDetails of Hendon Hookers Parents: Alan And Wendy Hooker, Family of NFL Player</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-its-really-like-to-be-poisoned-in-russia-and-survive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>What it's really like to be poisoned in Russia and survive</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-perrys-assisted-living-release-date-plot-cast-trailer-bet-sitcom-grandpa-grumpy.html>'Tyler Perry's Assisted Living': Release date, plot, cast, trailer and all you need to know about th</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-morrison-net-worth.html>Adam Morrison Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliya-janell-biography.html>Aliya Janell Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-stevenson-of-victoria-is-missing-help-police-to-find-her.html>Amanda Stevenson of Victoria is missing, help Police to find her</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./genesis-ali-dean.html>American Celebrity Kid, Genesis Ali Dean Is Youngest Son of American Well Known Musician Couple, Ali</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
