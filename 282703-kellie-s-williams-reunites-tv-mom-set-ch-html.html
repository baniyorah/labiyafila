He explained that some legal angles needed to be checked, and that may hinder a revival.</p><p class=dh>McCrary confessed that it had to do with issues regarding intellectual property and that there is a possibility they would be seen on TV again.</p><p class=dh>Willams added that even though they may never revive the series, the cast has kept in touch since the finale, which is one of the reasons she cast McCrary on "Christmas In Carolina."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DAUGHTER'S TV DEBUT AND CAST REUNION</strong></p><p class=dh>Williams's daughter Hannah Belle Jackson <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/entertainment/kellie-s-williams-merry-switchmas/>follows</a> in her mother's footsteps after landing her first movie role in the holiday movie "Merry Switchmas."</p><p class=dh>The movie is about identical twin sisters who switch places during their parents' annual Christmas celebration.
