After speaking with the officers, Angelina decided not to file charges,” Pivarnick’s attorney, James Leonard Jr., told Page Six in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>“This matter is now closed. Moving forward, Angelina would ask for privacy as it pertains to her personal life.”</p><p>Tortorella’s attorney, Elizabeth Rozin-Golinder, also told Page Six that he and Pivarnick are still engaged despite the incident.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter">Angelina Pivarnick called the cops on her fiancé, Vinny Tortorella, Page Six can exclusively reveal. <span class=credit>Instagram/angelinamtv</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Upon the authorities’ arrival at her Freehold, NJ, home, the “Jersey Shore” star declined to press charges.
