He was 27.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sometimes he struggled with depression, which is a serious thing with [the coronavirus pandemic] and everything happening right now and everybody being locked in the house," Howard tells PEOPLE. "It takes a lot. I wish I could have been there."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Howard says the pressure to live up to the Presley family name "absolutely" contributed to Keough's struggles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That kind of pressure is definitely a part of what happened," he says. "It's a tough thing when you have a lot of pressure with your family and living up to a name and an image. It's a lot of pressure. It's almost like you're pressured into having to be a musician, having to be an actor. It was good for him to go around the world and discover himself and have his own friends. You never know what triggers it. You never know ... It's so random."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite his own battles, Keough was always the first one there when his friends needed help, Howard says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He has always been there for everybody," he says. "In any kind of situation, he would be the one who would come crash with you on the couch for weeks until you're actually feeling better."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Benjamin Keough, Corey Feldman, Brandon Howard and friends.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brandon Howard/ Twitter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Howard first met Benjamin after Lisa Marie, 52, married <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michael Jackson</a> in 1994. In the '80s, Jackson's father Joe managed Howard's mother, "Baby, Be Mine" singer Miki Howard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lisa Marie and Jackson divorced in 1996, but Keough and Howard remained close in the years since. They even dubbed their friend group with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Corey Feldman</a> "the lost boys."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As adults, we had a brotherhood and a kind of respect," Howard says.

"He was like, 'Who does that serve? Does that serve you or does that serve everyone else's purpose? You are who you are, I am who I am. So it's up to us. We don't have anything to prove. We just live our lives. Those who know it, they know.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to being a talented musician, Keough was "an excellent chef" and all around "wonderful" human, Howard says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was super inspiring," he says. "He was cool and very intelligent, intelligent beyond his years. He was multi-faceted. He could be anywhere from serious, giving advice, to like super crazy and wild and dancing and partying. He was a very loving person as a brother."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As to what he'll miss most about Keough, Howard says it's his "laugh and his eyes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He had the craziest laugh," he says. "I want people to know about his humility. He wasn't a spoiled kid. He was very humble, very giving, very loving, especially to his friends. It's just wild.
