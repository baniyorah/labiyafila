The mother was watching her children in the water when she noticed hands flailing in the water in front of her.</p><p class=Zg>A group of three children were pulled into the deep waters of Lake Michigan after being swept up by rip currents. DeWitt, who was five months pregnant at the time, was the only one close enough to come to their aid.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Blue and white life saver buoy attached to a pole. | Pexels/ Athena</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>SAVING THREE LIVES</strong></p><p class=Zg>The children, all under the age of 15, were being slammed against the pier wall as DeWitt came to their rescue.
