A member of the veteran Houston rap trio Geto Boys, Bill had revealed last month that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in February.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/880baab6-e795-4ea9-b23b-8d65b2b3a488.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reports</a>, Bill’s publicist, Dawn P, that the rapper died Sunday at 9:35 p.m., local time, at a Colorado hospital. The publicist also said that the rapper, whose legal name is Richard Shaw, was surrounded by family when he died. The rapper's son, Javon, told <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a>&nbsp; that Bill's final words were, "I will love you forever."</p><p>The news of his death began circulating early Sunday after fellow Geto Boy Scarface posted on Instagram saying: "RIP Bushwick Bill. You will be missed big fella." Soon his daughter and his publicist slammed the reports of his death saying that he was still 'fighting for his life'.&nbsp;She said on Instagram, "Certain people have been so quick to write him off as dead so they can capitalize off it."&nbsp;She stressed, "There is no Geto Boys without Bushwick Bill."</p><p>Bill's publicist also insisted that the rapper was still alive and was on a ventilator at a Colorado hospital. But the same publicist confirmed that he died at 9:35 p.m. CST. Pete Marrero, Bill’s Dallas-based business manager, said he was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in February and was not expected to recover.</p><p>The Jamaican-born rapper, while speaking about his illness, had said: "I figure keeping it myself is not really helping nobody, and I’m not really afraid of dying because if anyone knows anything about me from [his 1992 song] ‘Ever So Clear,’ I died and came back already in June 1991, so I know what it’s like on the other side." He was referring to the time he accidentally shot himself in the eye while tussling with his girlfriend over a gun. He had been planning to go on tour around the time he was hospitalized.</p><p>Bill was born with dwarfism and joined the Geto Boys in 1986, after performing as the group’s dancer. He is a founding member of Geto Boys.&nbsp; Bushwick Bill, Scarface and Willie D became the Geto Boys in Houston back in 1988 and signed with J. Prince's Rap-A-Lot Records.&nbsp;</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, the trio was planning a reunion but plans fells through at the last minute.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpGlvaa%2BjJusrKCnnrCsecGio6Vln5t6tbTEZp6erJ9ir7DF0mabop2jYq6nwMSrZJuZpKm5qrrGZqeappOnsqLAyJxknJmemLKz</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-michelle-gellar-has-two-kids-with-her-husband.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Michelle Gellar Has Two Kids With Her Husband Freddie Prinze Jr., Kids And Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pepper-binkley-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pepper Binkley Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-perrys-assisted-living-release-date-plot-cast-trailer-bet-sitcom-grandpa-grumpy.html>'Tyler Perry's Assisted Living': Release date, plot, cast, trailer and all you need to know about th</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-morrison-net-worth.html>Adam Morrison Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliya-janell-biography.html>Aliya Janell Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-stevenson-of-victoria-is-missing-help-police-to-find-her.html>Amanda Stevenson of Victoria is missing, help Police to find her</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./genesis-ali-dean.html>American Celebrity Kid, Genesis Ali Dean Is Youngest Son of American Well Known Musician Couple, Ali</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
