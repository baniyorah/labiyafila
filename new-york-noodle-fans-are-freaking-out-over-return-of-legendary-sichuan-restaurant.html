The master, who’s 65, is back in the kitchen <a href=# rel=noopener>at this unrecognizably larger and more opulent version</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/cuozzo_tang1a.jpg><p>The seminal dish — invented by Chen Lieh’s late father, the legendary “Shorty” Tang — helped catalyze the great regional-Chinese boom that also introduced New Yorkers to Hunanese, Fujian and Shanghai-style cooking.</p><p>Shorty Tang was born in Sichuan province and fled to Taiwan in 1949 after the Communists took over mainland. He came to New York in 1955 and, with the help of a “garmento,” his grandson James Tang says, launched Hwa Yuan in a former textile factory.</p><p>Although Shorty moved to the US when Chen Lieh was 13, he wasn’t able to leave Taiwan until he was 21. He plunged into his father’s business at Hwa Yuan, “doing every job,” he told us. Shorty passed away at age 50 in 1974, and Chen Lieh took over until it closed.</p><p>The Tang family owned the building and leased it to a Bank of China branch. Chen Lieh retired from restaurants. When the lease was up a few years ago, the family wasn’t sure what to do with it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/cuozzo_inside1a.jpg><p>“The building was a complete money pit,” says James, a son of Chen Lieh who is an investment banker, as well as a partner in the new Hwa Yuan. “At first, we thought we’d put in another bank, the easiest kind of tenant.”</p><p>But then, James recalls, “Wellington Chen, the head of the Chinatown business improvement district, suggested to my father that he reopen the restaurant. He said Chinatown needed new restaurants” — which it did. There are fewer eateries of any kind than in the past, and many new ones serve Japanese, Vietnamese or Thai food.</p><p>Chen Lieh was quick to take Chen’s advice.</p><p>“My dad knew so much of Manhattan’s Chinese food was crap,” says James — undercut by immigration laws that made it almost impossible for chefs from China to move here, among other factors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/cuozzo_shorty1a.jpg><p>“We knew it would be a lot of work, but we decided to do it 2¹/₂ years ago,” James adds. “It was a long demolition. We had to remove vaults.”</p><p>They spent “millions” to create a three-level, 21st-century Hwa Yuan. The result is exotic without being cliched or garish. A dramatically glowing wall behind the ground-floor onyx bar is made of orange Spanish marble that was shipped to China for cutting into thin, translucent segments. Screens separating the upstairs dining rooms are of hand-carved Chinese mahogany.</p><p>A giant, conical tank — Chen Lieh calls it “the bullet” — rotates ducks for a Beijing-style preparation, one of the menu’s non-Sichuanese dishes, along with “Chinese” Caesar salad. There’s also a steakhouselike raw bar for shrimp and lobster cocktail, but my favorite dish was Grand Marnier prawns, intoxicating in every way, without a trace of the classic’s too-common thick flour-and-mayo coating.</p><p>Boys, welcome back to the block — and the wok!</p><h2>Recipe for success</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/cuozzo_tang2a.jpg><p>Before Japanese ramen or Shanghai-style wheat noodles conquered New York palates, Hwa Yuan’s cold, round egg noodles ruled the Chinatown night.</p><p>“Shorty” Tang dressed them with a mysterious blend of soy sauce, peanut butter, rice wine, black vinegar, chili, scallions and sesame oil. It yielded a supernova of mingling, tingling flavors and tactile gratification. The velvety noodles conveyed notes sweet, spicy and tart.</p><p>Tang’s recipe spread to other eateries he owned and to scores of imitators. Over time, “cold spicy sesame noodles” declined into a feeble, peanut-buttery burlesque of the real thing.</p><p>The version his son, Chen Lieh Tang, serves at the new Hwa Yuan hews almost precisely to the original, although the key, grandson James Tang says, is “a very specific ratio” of elements that is a “secret formula.”</p><p>The handmade noodles are boiled and chilled. The sauce is made from all the components stirred in “a big vat.”</p><p>It lacked only one thing to my taste: not enough chili. “It’s scaled back a little to make it more palatable to more people,” James acknowledged. “But we’ll ask people what their preference is.”</p><p>They don’t have to ask me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7kGlmamhfo7K4edioqaRlnqS8pbjEZp2apqNirrOxjJ%2Bpnpmbnruoec6uq2anppq%2Fbr7Erayrpl2ks264xKCcp5yRp8Zuv8icn66ZnmK%2Fpr%2FTmqyrmZ6pfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oryan-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ORyan Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./messiah-chords-by-francesca-battistelli.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>MESSIAH CHORDS by Francesca Battistelli</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-perrys-assisted-living-release-date-plot-cast-trailer-bet-sitcom-grandpa-grumpy.html>'Tyler Perry's Assisted Living': Release date, plot, cast, trailer and all you need to know about th</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-morrison-net-worth.html>Adam Morrison Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliya-janell-biography.html>Aliya Janell Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-stevenson-of-victoria-is-missing-help-police-to-find-her.html>Amanda Stevenson of Victoria is missing, help Police to find her</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./genesis-ali-dean.html>American Celebrity Kid, Genesis Ali Dean Is Youngest Son of American Well Known Musician Couple, Ali</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
