Unger was born on 12 July 1965, in Dayton, Ohio, USA, to Eleanor and Richard Unger, of Romanian descent. He is an actor, comedian, TV correspondent, writer, producer and commentator, but probably best known for his work as a producer and correspondent of the comedy news program “The Daily Show”.</p><p>So just how rich is Brian Unger now? Sources state that Unger has accumulated a fortune of over $500,000, as of early 2017. His net worth has come from his involvement in various sectors of the entertainment industry which began in the late 1980s.</p><h3>Brian Unger Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Unger grew up in Granville, Ohio, where he attended Granville High School and later enrolled at Ohio University, earning a degree in communication.</p><p>His career in showbiz began during his student days at Ohio, when he worked at the university’s radio and television station WOUB-TV on a comedy television show called “Fridays Live”. In 1993 he became an intern at NBC, working for the legendary talk-show host David Letterman, so his net worth was well established.</p><p>He eventually left this position at NBC to produce 26 episodes of the television show called “Obstetrics & Gynecology Update” for Lifetime Medical Television, then went on to produce various documentaries related to veterans of military service dating back to World War I. All contributed to his net worth.</p><p>Unger then became a field producer for TV pioneer <a href=#>Maury Povich</a>, whose wife, <a href=#>Connie Chung</a>, soon hired him as an associate producer on her CBS News magazine show called “Eye to Eye”. Three years later, he became an on-air correspondent for the CBS magazine show “Day & Date”, paving his way to recognition and increasing his wealth.</p><p>In 1996 Unger became one of the first producers and correspondents for Comedy Central’s news satire and late-night talk show “The Daily Show”, reporting on politics, people and events around the country. His involvement in the show enabled him to achieve a great deal of popularity, being named one of Entertainment Weekly’s ‘100 Most Creative People in Entertainment’. It also earned him a considerable net worth; he remained on the show until 1999.</p><p>Unger also appeared in numerous Comedy Central specials during this time, such as “Unauthorized Biography: Milo, Death of a Supermodel” and “The Daily Show Beach House”, among others, and later worked on a variety of television projects, including NBC’s “Later”, E! Entertainment’s “Talk Soup”, “Hollywood Off-Ramp”, various “I Love the…” shows on VH1 and Comedy Central’s “The Man Show”, to name a few.</p><p>He produced shows for MTV and Oxygen too, such as the popular comedy series “O2Be…Anyone But Me”. All added to his fortune.</p><p>Unger has hosted MSNBC’s show “Countdown with <a href=#>Keith Olbermann</a>” , “Discovery Channel’s “Some Assembly Required” and PBS’ “Wired Science”. He also served as the host of the documentary series “How the States Got Their Shapes” in 2011-2012, while also being one of the show’s producers. In 2014 he co-hosted “Showdown of the Unbeatables”, further expanding his wealth.</p><p>Speaking about his career as a commentator, Unger served as a regular commentator of the NPR radio news magazine show “Day to Day” from 2003 to 2009. His written commentary has appeared in major magazines such as The New York Times and The Minneapolis Star Tribune. In addition, he has written a book review for The Washington Post. He currently provides his commentary to NPR’s news program “All Things Considered” and to the internet talk show “The Young Turks”.</p><p>As for his acting career, he has appeared in comedy television series such as “Three Sisters”, “Just Shoot Me”, “I’m with Her”, “Reno 911!”, “Don’t Make Me Sick” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”. He has also landed a couple of film parts, in “Fired Up!” and “Gentlemen Broncos”. Unger’s acting career has been an additional source of his net worth.</p><p>Speaking of Unger’s private life, there are no information known to media about it, so inevitably rumours circulate about his sexuality. He currently resides in Los Angeles.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=14.266081871345><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Brian Unger</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 12, 1965</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Dayton, Ohio, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.85 m</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Comedian, Writer, Television producer, Commentator</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Ohio University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Eleanor Oprea, Richard Unger</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Brian D.
