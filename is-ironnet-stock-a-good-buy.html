While IronNet’s earnings were largely in line with expectations, markets became overly euphoric after the earnings release.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Why is IRNT stock falling?</h2><p>IRNT stock is falling because its price was out of sync with the company’s fundamentals. As is the case with other short squeezes, IronNet has pared its gains and is now near its price when its merger was completed. That said, it has fallen enough to look attractive.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">IronNet stock forecast 2021</h2><p>Through its Collective Defense Platform, IronNet uses AI-driven behavioral analytics to detect cyber anomalies.
