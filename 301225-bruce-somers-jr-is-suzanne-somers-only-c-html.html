The then-young actress struggled to make ends meet and resorted to fraud, for which she was caught and arrested.</p><p class=dh>Bruce Somers Jr was born in 1965 to Suzanne and Bruce Somers. His parents had married that same year when Suzanne was 19 years old. However, their union didn't last long, as they divorced in 1968.</p><p class=dh>The separation left Suzanne alone as a single mother, and she struggled to stay financially afloat while raising Bruce Jr. Still, she fought to ensure her son felt loved, safe, and cared for, as his touching Instagram tributes to the actress have revealed.</p><p class=dh>Bruce Jr frequently referred to Suzanne as a warrior with a big heart and always raved about her fierce affections. He chose a slightly different career from his mom's and raised his own family for the better part of the last thirty years.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Bruce Somers Jr. Grew up in Austerity When Mom Struggled to Make Ends Meet</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Despite <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4828795/how-many-children-does-suzanne-somers-have/>his parents' divorce</a>, Bruce Jr kept his father's name.

Although he survived, he battled recurring nightmares. Suzanne then took him for counseling at a community health center, where they paid $1 a visit.</p><p class=dh>A year later, Bruce Jr's counselor was confident he was fine but brought it to Suzanne's attention that she also needed counseling. Describing her as a "walking apology," the counselor told her he'd never met anyone with "such low self-esteem."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Bruce Jr. Always Has His Mom's Back & Reassurance</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Bruce Jr. hasn't missed her birthday or a Mother's Day to show his appreciation for Suzanne's acts of love as she raised him.
