These people cross that boundary.”</p><p>The Ulas family was described in the documentary as “the missing link between man and ape” — and a Turkish study suggested that “devolution” might have occurred, reversing three million years of evolution.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Ulas family was described in the documentary as “the missing link between man and ape.” <span class=credit>60 Minutes Australia</span></figure><p>But Humphrey slammed that theory in the BBC doc, calling it “deeply insulting” and “scientifically irresponsible.”</p><p>The documentary also maintained the family’s “untold significance for every one of us” and claimed they “shouldn’t exist.”</p><p>Researchers at Liverpool University found that the children at the center of the study had skeletons with more resemblance to apes than humans and had a shrunken cerebellum, a condition that doesn’t usually effect other humans’ ability to walk on their two legs, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Star</a>.</p><p>However, while apes use their knuckles to get around, these humans use the palms of their hands, marking a significant difference.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The documentary maintained the family’s “untold significance for every one of us” and claimed they “shouldn’t exist.” <span class=credit>60 Minutes Australia</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Researchers at Liverpool University found that the children at the center of the study had skeletons with more resemblance to apes than humans and had a shrunken cerebellum. <span class=credit>60 Minutes Australia</span></figure><p>“I think it’s possible that what we are seeing in this family is something that does correspond to a time when we didn’t walk like chimpanzees but was an important step between coming down from the trees and becoming fully bipedal,” Humphrey suggested.</p><p>He also noted that since the children were not necessarily encouraged to stand after 9 months old, their development could have been affected.</p><p>The children were provided with a physiotherapist as well as equipment used to help them walk on just two feet, which led to significant improvements in mobility by the time Humphrey returned to Turkey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma3Ffm66utcuyZK2gkal6uK3LpKpmp55irq24jJ%2BmrqqjYq%2BissWlnKxlo5i2prrToqqtq12otbDBy52lrWWVrba0wI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./212546-fantasia-barrino-looks-emotional-husband-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fantasia Barrino Gets Emotional as Husband Kendall Taylor Speaks out on Racial Injustice</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eva-gonda-rivera-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eva Gonda Rivera Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-perrys-assisted-living-release-date-plot-cast-trailer-bet-sitcom-grandpa-grumpy.html>'Tyler Perry's Assisted Living': Release date, plot, cast, trailer and all you need to know about th</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-morrison-net-worth.html>Adam Morrison Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliya-janell-biography.html>Aliya Janell Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-stevenson-of-victoria-is-missing-help-police-to-find-her.html>Amanda Stevenson of Victoria is missing, help Police to find her</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./genesis-ali-dean.html>American Celebrity Kid, Genesis Ali Dean Is Youngest Son of American Well Known Musician Couple, Ali</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
