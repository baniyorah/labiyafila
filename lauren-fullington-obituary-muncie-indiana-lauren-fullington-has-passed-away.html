He left this world on October 5, 2023, at the Hartville Care Center, also located in Hartville, Missouri. His parents, David and Laura Fullington, both passed away before to his birth. He had lived for 72 years, 4 months, and 22 days when he passed away.<br>Hartville, Missouri was where Charles spent his childhood and received his education. He attended Hartville High School and received his diploma with the class of 1970. The majority of Charles’ life was spent toiling away on the family farm. In addition to that, he worked in Kansas as a bouncer, and he also spent some time working at the Springfield Locker Plant.<br>Charles took his family to worship services at the Hartville Church of God on a weekly basis. He had a lot of fun working on the farm, and in his spare time, he enjoyed going fishing and riding his bike with his family. Before moving to the Hartville Care Center in 2006, Charles remained at his childhood home on the farm for as long as he was physically able to do so.<br>His maternal grandparents, David and Laura Fullington, as well as one sister, Betty Hill, and two infant brothers and sisters, all passed away before Charles. He is survived by two brothers, David Fullington, Jr., and Jesse Fullington, as well as four sisters, Elsie Huston, Joan Reed, Mary Swan, and Ava Fullington, as well as a large number of nephews, nieces, neighbors, and friends who will miss him. He passed away in 1922.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwuMCuqZ6mXZvCrbjIp56tp55ivKO1066Yq7FdosKvr8ieZKKmlJ6ur62MpZiuqpWjeqfBy6Wgp5%2BkpLtutMCsZKmZo6iypXnAsJiyZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leann-rimes-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LeAnn Rimes Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-groban.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Groban Bio, Age, Wife, Girlfriend, Married, Net Worth and Height</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-perrys-assisted-living-release-date-plot-cast-trailer-bet-sitcom-grandpa-grumpy.html>'Tyler Perry's Assisted Living': Release date, plot, cast, trailer and all you need to know about th</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-morrison-net-worth.html>Adam Morrison Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliya-janell-biography.html>Aliya Janell Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-stevenson-of-victoria-is-missing-help-police-to-find-her.html>Amanda Stevenson of Victoria is missing, help Police to find her</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./genesis-ali-dean.html>American Celebrity Kid, Genesis Ali Dean Is Youngest Son of American Well Known Musician Couple, Ali</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
