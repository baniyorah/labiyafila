His career from that point included numerous acting roles as well as wildly successful rock albums and singles. He experienced several incidences of falling off stages while performing, most recently in 2019. “I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That)” is one of his most iconic songs.</p><p><strong>Birthdate</strong>: September 27, 1947</p><p><strong>Spouse</strong>: Deborah Aday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Meat Loaf had a successful music career.</h2><p>As a musician, Meat Loaf’s top two albums came out in 1977 and 1993.
