She shares three children with Culter: a daughter, Saylor James, and two sons, Jaxon Wyatt, Camden Jack. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In a recent&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with People</a>, Cavallari talked about her life post-divorce, living with kids, and how her parents' divorce has helped her now understand her kids' emotions.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"It's changed on many fronts. I think the biggest front for me would be that my life has slowed down so incredibly much. I have a lot more time on my hands, which has been really nice," she said, briefing her life in the last year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Kristin Cavallari Felt like She Was Drowning</h2><p>During the previous conversation, Cavallari — who first rose to fame after her appearance on MTV's reality TV show&nbsp;Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County&nbsp;in 2004 — stated she felt like she was almost drowning a year ago. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>She explained that she was filming a show, trying to wrap up her comfort food cookbook,&nbsp;True Comfort, and parallelly, she was still a married wife with a husband and three kids. But after a particular point in time, she felt like there was so much going on in her life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The reality TV star subsequently got divorced from her longtime partner, which added extra responsibilities on her head to look after her kids. That is because, even though she and her ex-husband are co-parents, the kids mostly live with her and makes her more responsible for the children. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>The Lesson from Her Parents' Divorce Helped Her as a Parent</h2><p>When&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Cavallari</a>&nbsp;was very young, her parents, Judith Eifrig and Dennis Cavallari, divorced. After the divorce, she initially moved with her mother to Barrington, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and lived there until her junior year of high school. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Years later, she traveled to Laguna Beach, California, to live with her father and late older brother, Michael Cavallari.</p><p>But during those years, she also learned what it felt like being a child whose parents were divorced. She understood the things kids missed out on and knew the emotion relating to such situations. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>I understand what they're going through because I've been through it, and I can take what I appreciated from both of my parents or the stuff that maybe didn't sit well with me, and I can apply it to my kids.</p><p>Hence, when she herself got a divorce and realized her kids had to go through the same fate as she did, she knew how to understand her children's emotions better.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm actually thankful now that I went through all of that and that my parents are not still together, to be honest," she added, speaking to the previous publication.</p><h2>Kristin Cavallari’s Relationship with Her Own Father</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Cavallari and her father Dennis became distant from each other after the death of her brother in 2015. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cavallari’s brother reportedly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">went missing</a>&nbsp;after his abandoned car was found on a highway in Utah. Sometime later,&nbsp;Michael's&nbsp;body was found far away from his car, and the&nbsp;autopsy suggested that&nbsp;he died because of hypothermia. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In February 2021, the father-daughter duo finally <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met each other</a> after years, ending their sour relationship.
