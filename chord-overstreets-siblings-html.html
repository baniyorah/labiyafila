He shared it was his parents who played the biggest role.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He was born to the hugely popular country musician and songwriter Paul Overstreet and his make-up artist wife, Julie Miller. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Growing up with my dad being a 2 time Grammy-winner, BMI songwriter of the year for five consecutive years in a row, and having the legacy he has is definitely a huge influence too,” he said.</p><p>“I got to write a lot with him growing up and he kind of showed me the ropes. I always wanted to be like my dad.”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Chord also shared his mother was his “biggest cheerleader” and that she would drive him back and forth to guitar lessons growing up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an Instagram post in May 2021, he posted a picture of himself and his siblings along with their mother and thanked her for her support.</p><p></p><p><strong>Chord Overstreet with his mother and siblings</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“These photos sum it all up!!

Nash is a part of the band Hot Chelle Rae that had hits such as ‘Tonight Tonight,’ ‘I Like It Like That,’ and ‘Honestly.’</p><p>As a songwriter, Nash has co-written songs like ‘Liar’ for <a href=# rel=follow>Britney Spears</a> and ‘Woman Up’ for Meghan Trainor. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Like Nash, Chord’s older sister, Summer Overstreet is also a singer and songwriter.
