After several years of being married to Tamera Mowry, a proud black woman, Adam Housley still gets criticized for apparently being racist.</p><p class=dh>Recently, he shared a photo of his family, which included his husband Tamera and their two children, people were quick to notice how his caption spoke about craziness on "all sides".</p><p class=dh>Users thought that this could actually be a racist comment, especially since President Donald Trump recently used the statement <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/>"some very fine people on both sides"</a>, using it to describe white and colored people.</p><p class=dh>With Housley's former connection to Fox News and his own race, people were quick to jump into their own conclusions of him using the same statement to describe his own family.</p><p class=dh>However, having enough of the rumors, Tamera made sure to defend him on her own daytime show "The Real".</p><p class=dh>“There are some people who think that my husband is racist because he worked for a certain channel.

Despite everything that life throws at him, and despite how tired he gets at times, he always makes sure to keep a smile on his face and that's because of how much he loves his family. After all, his interracial family is one of the clearest reasons as to why he is definitely not a racist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpncGxhaHq1rcyeqZplnaTEs8WMrKOapZ2asW601KyZmqaUYq5uvsCcoKysXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teddi-mellencamp-kids-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teddi Mellencamp Got Sweet Letters from Kids and Husband While on Celebrity Big Brother</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-cole-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Cole Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-perrys-assisted-living-release-date-plot-cast-trailer-bet-sitcom-grandpa-grumpy.html>'Tyler Perry's Assisted Living': Release date, plot, cast, trailer and all you need to know about th</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-morrison-net-worth.html>Adam Morrison Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliya-janell-biography.html>Aliya Janell Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-stevenson-of-victoria-is-missing-help-police-to-find-her.html>Amanda Stevenson of Victoria is missing, help Police to find her</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./genesis-ali-dean.html>American Celebrity Kid, Genesis Ali Dean Is Youngest Son of American Well Known Musician Couple, Ali</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
