My dad is an excellent musician in his own right, an accomplished harmonica player, and he loves his oldies, which span genres from Patsy Cline to Nina Simone.”</p><p>Bruce’s family <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the “Pulp Fiction” star had been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnosed with aphasia</a> — a brain disorder that affected his ability to communicate and caused problems on the sets of films — in March 2022.</p><p>In February, they revealed that he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">received a more specific diagnosis</a>: frontotemporal dementia.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Bruce Willis and Tallulah Willis celebrated his 60th birthday at Harlow on March 21, 2015, in NYC. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Tallulah claimed that she never felt “interesting enough” for her dad. <span class=credit>Tallulah Willis/Instagram</span></figure><p>As for the current status of her father’s memory, Tallulah said he still recognizes her, but she also takes lots of pictures around the house and saves all his voicemails “for the day when he isn’t there to remind me of him and of us,” she revealed.</p><p>“He still knows who I am and lights up when I enter the room,” she claimed “I keep flipping between the present and the past when I talk about Bruce: he is, he was, he is, he was. That’s because I have hopes for my father that I’m so reluctant to let go of.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Tallulah recalled how hurtful comments made online about her “ugly” appearance impacted her self-worth.</p><p>“‘Wow, she looks deformed. Look at her man jaw — she’s like an ugly version of her dad. Her mother must be so disappointed,'” she remembered commenters critiquing a photo of her teenage self while “standing beside my famously beautiful mom.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rumer Willis (from left), Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and Tallulah Belle Willis attend the after party for the Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis at NeueHouse on July 14, 2018, in Los Angeles. <span class=credit>Getty Images For Comedy Central</span></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The comments about Tallulah <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not looking like her mother</a> bothered her for many years — a feeling she also felt when Bruce’s health started to decline.</p><p>She claimed she knew something was “wrong” with Bruce for a “long time” before<a href=#> his initial aphasia diagnosis</a>.</p><p>“It started out with a kind of vague unresponsiveness, which the family chalked up to Hollywood hearing loss: ‘Speak up!&nbsp;‘Die Hard’&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">messed with Dad’s ears,</a>‘” she recalled.</p><p>“Later that unresponsiveness broadened, and I sometimes took it personally. He had had<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> two babies</a> with my stepmother, Emma Heming Willis, and I thought he’d lost interest in me.”</p><p>Tallulah continued: “Though this couldn’t have been further from the truth, my adolescent brain tortured itself with some faulty math: I’m not beautiful enough for my mother, I’m not interesting enough for my father.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Bruce Willis was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in February. <span class=credit>buuski/Instagram</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rumer Willis (from left), father Bruce Willis, sister Tallulah Belle Willis, mother Demi Moore and sister Scout LaRue Willis pose backstage as Rumer makes her Broadway debut as Roxie Hart in Broadway’s “Chicago” at the Ambassador Theater on Sept. 21, 2015. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>The Post has contacted representatives for Bruce and Moore for comment.</p><p>The Vogue piece also discussed Tallulah’s struggles with anorexia nervosa and ADHD, as well as a new Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis she received last June while at a treatment facility following her split from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her then-fiancé</a>&nbsp;Dillon Buss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mbGlfl7%2B2r8RmrqKknJ7AbrDEppynrJmWera8w5qrnmWYmnq0wMilo2ajnqTEtHnWoaZmoV2Wum6wwK6eoayVp3q1rculrKWZmGLAosXSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-de-rakoff-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex De Rakoff Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selah-marley-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are Selah Marley Parents?
