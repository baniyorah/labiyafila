It is an electronic commerce company. However, he has also extended his company to a lot of different fields like streaming services, film productions, and video games among others.</p><p>Preston's father would probably have much bigger wealth if wasn't for the divorce from his mother, Mackenzie Scott.

Jeff had to pay <strong>$38.3 Billion</strong> to settle his divorce.</p><h2>Relationship Status: Does Preston Have A Girlfriend?</h2><p>Preston Bezos at the moment does not have any partner and is living a single life. He is still in his 20s so getting involved in a relationship is the least of his worry.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, most of Preston's time is invested in his education and making a career. The other time, he is making the most out of his single life and is enjoying time with his friend and family.</p><p>Jeff's oldest son, Preston lives a quiet life and hasn't revealed much about his love life. Hence, there are no records of his previous relationships. He is also absent from social media which makes it hard to keep track of his life.</p><h2>Preston's Parents Are No Longer Together</h2><p>Preston's parents sadly no longer live under the same roof as they have divorced. Jeff Bezos and Mackenzie Scott. The two officially filed for divorce on <strong>July 5, 2019</strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>Jeff&nbsp;and &nbsp;Mackenzie&nbsp;were married for more than two decades.

They were only married for a year as it lasted from March 2021 to September 2022.</p><h2>Preston Isn't The Only Child Of Bezos</h2><p>Preston is the oldest but he isn't the only child Jeff had with his ex-wife, Mackenzie. He has three siblings, two brothers, and one sister. Jeff is a popular figure automatically making his kids a celebrity. But, he wants to give all of his kids a normal childhood.</p><p>Hence, Preston's siblings remain a mystery to this day. Their names remain to be known and have hardly made any appearance with their father.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one thing that is known about Jeff kid's is that only his sons are his biological child but the same thing can't be said about their daughter as she was adopted.</p><h2>Studies In The Same Institute As His Father</h2><p>Preston is a student at the time of this writing and he is currently studying in the same Institute as his father, Jeff.
